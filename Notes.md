# Miziziziz_Continued
Started Game Developement 8/18/2020 for Miz 1 Jam, The theme was to use the Art Assests

Need to do:
Add a Pause Screen to both tutorial and Scene1
Tone Down difficulty curve a bit
(Wizard moves faster than fireball?!?) Tone down Wizard speed
Sometimes a wizard skips his first shot and waits for the timer to shoot "again" (his first time)

Bugs:
If player shoots when Index == 4 and the sentence hasn't ended then it breaks the code
Change code in Scoring Manager to if(press.R){LoadScene("Scene1");}
