# Miziziziz_Continued
Started Game Developement 8/18/2020 for Miz 1 Jam, The theme was to use the Art Assests

- Need to do:
Add a Pause Screen to both tutorial and Scene1
Add Noise to every time it's a new round and when dashing
(Wizard moves faster than fireball?!?) Tone down Wizard speed
Sometimes a wizard skips his first shot and waits for the timer to shoot "again" (his first time)

- Bugs:
Player dashes for much longer than intended

- Ideas:

- Upgrades Ideas:
A drone that circles around the player and occasionally shoots an enemy, transform.RotateAround(sphereOne.transform.position, sphereOne.transform.up, 100*Time.deltaTime);
Can occasionally set down a trap
A 2nd Life
(Needs Pathfinding) Can pour water/place barrels to make walls


- Notes:
Font, Perpetua Titling MT
