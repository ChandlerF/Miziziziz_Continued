# Miziziziz_Continued
Started Game Developement 8/18/2020 for Miz 1 Jam, The theme was to use the Art Assests

- Need to do:
Add a Pause Screen to both tutorial and Scene1
Tone Down difficulty curve a bit
(Wizard moves faster than fireball?!?) Tone down Wizard speed
Sometimes a wizard skips his first shot and waits for the timer to shoot "again" (his first time)
Increase speed of text by lowering it to something like 0.3

- Bugs:
If player shoots when Index == 4 && Sentence isn't fully written then it breaks the code
Same thing if Index == 2 ^^
Change code in Scoring Manager to if(press.R){LoadScene("Scene1");}

- Ideas:
Have rounds that last every 10 enemies or so and after each round you can choose an upgrade between 3 choices (ie: FireRate, Arrows per Shot, and Player Speed)

- Upgrades Ideas:
A drone that circles around the player and occasionally shoots an enemy
Can occasionally set down a trap
A Second Life
(Needs Pathfinding) Can pour water/place barrels to make walls
A Dash Ability


- Notes:
Font, Perpetua Titling MT
