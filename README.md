Need to do:
Add a Pause Screen to both tutorial and Scene1
Tone Down difficulty curve a bit
(Wizard moves faster than fireball?!?) Tone down Wizard speed
Sometimes when a wizard is right above or below the player he skips his first shot and waits for the timer to shoot "again" (his first time)

Bugs:
If player shoots when Index == 4 and the sentence hasn't ended then it breaks the code
Change code in Scoring Manager to if(press.R){LoadScene("Scene1");}
